In this text-file known and not fixed bugs should be contained.

[OPEN][1]
Using Windows 7 and Matlab Version R2011b: at adding a new dynamical template, a message, but no
crash, appears: 'Undefined function 'mtids' for input arguments of type 'struct'.'.

[OPEN][2]
The generation of plots should also be possible when starting the simulation directly in Simulink.
This is not possible now. Acutally, the simulaton may be started in MTIDS

[OPEN][3]
To deal with [2], the subsystem templates were extend with naming the ouput signals 'Nodeout'. But
during the 'Export to Simulink 2' function, the name is not dynamically concatenated with the node
number. Problem here is to find the correct system attribute, which may be edited programmatically.

[OPEN][4]
In the 'Edit Node' figure, which opens by double clicking a node, the prompting of the 
interconncetions will not discriminate between undirected and directed modus. This must be done
by passing the corresponding global flag in the main m-file to 'Edit Node'. The design of the figure
may be changed dynamically due to space limitations.

[OPEN][5]
In the m-file "template2modify.m", the case that a node has no entry is only considered for LTI-
templates. The other templates should also be edited correctly.
