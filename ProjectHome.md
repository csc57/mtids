# MTIDS   #
MATLAB Toolbox for Interconnected Dynamical Systems is a project that aims to design an easy to use and flexible toolbox to make the simulation of large scale dynamical systems easier for students and researchers. The goal is to produce a mash-up that wraps different toolboxes used for graph analysis and
dynamic systems simulation together into a framework.
MTIDS is an open-source project under the GNU GPL v2 license.

## **Current version 1.4 has been released, now including a user guide that explains the functionality of MTIDS.** ##

MTIDS in a nutshell:

![https://sites.google.com/site/mtidsimages/home/mtidsStructure1.png](https://sites.google.com/site/mtidsimages/home/mtidsStructure1.png)


## Features: ##

- Full integration with MATLAB and Simulink for simulation and
analysis

- Easy Drag and Drop visual interface for building systems

- Visualization of key graph properties

- Nonlinear and switching behavior possible at node level

- Highly customizable thanks to templates

- Extensible

- Directed and undirected graphs

- Creation of graphs described by statistical measures (e.g. Small-World, Scale-Free)


## Join us !!! ##
We are currently looking to expand MTIDS and we would appreciate any help with the development of any of the following features:

- Support for import from Simulink or import of graph matrices.

- Support for switching interconnections.

**If you have any questions or suggestion, please do not hesitate to send us an Email.**
