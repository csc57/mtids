# Introduction #

Today we are faced with real world control problems that can neither be understood nor tackled by
classical control / system theory. Such systems are referred to as large-scale, and complex dynamical
systems, e.g. electric-power grids, the world-wide-web, but also globalized economics or metabolic
processes, etc.
A common feature is that global network behavior results from interaction on a local scale, i.e. local
dynamical systems (agents) being coupled according to an interconnection structure (graph), thus
forming a distributed multi-agent system. Due to the ubiquity and importance of such systems, theory
tries to understand the emergence of collective behavior.
Experiments and testing are often impossible in a real-world setup; a numerical test rig would ease
and foster research in this field.
